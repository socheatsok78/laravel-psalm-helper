# Laravel Psalm Helper

A zero-config installer for Psalm (a static analysis tool thatâ€™s designed to improve large PHP codebases by identifying both obvious and hard-to-spot bugs)

## Installaion
```bash
composer require --dev socheatsok78/laravel-psalm-helper
```

### Usage

Add a `psalm.xml` config:

```bash
./vendor/bin/psalm --init [source_directory=src] [config_level=3]
```

where `config_level` represents how strict you want Psalm to be. `1` is the strictest, `8` is the most lenient.

Example:
```console
$ ./vendor/bin/psalm --init src 3
Config file created successfully. Please re-run psalm.
```

Then run Psalm:

```bash
./vendor/bin/psalm
```
